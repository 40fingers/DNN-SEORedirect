# DNN-SEORedirect
The SEO redirect module was first created by us in 2012 when we “converted” a client website from PHP to DNN. Because the existing website ranked quite well in google we needed a way to add mapping for redirects from the old pages to the new ones.
Over the years we have add more functionality to the module and its interface and we now use it on most of our websites.

## 404 and 30x
For SEO, it’s useful to redirect renamed or moved pages or files to their new location.
Although DNN has built in functionality for renamed pages, it does not for all other situations.
The SEO redirect allows you to see the incoming 404’s and add a redirect them to a new location if needed.

As of version 2.6 you can configure each mapping to use a different http status than (the default) 301.
